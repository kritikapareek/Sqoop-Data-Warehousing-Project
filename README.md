# Sqoop-Data-Warehousing-Project
This is an academic project to get better understanding about the working of Apache Sqoop.  


While working with Bigdata, there is a constant updation in the database
entries in the real time. We need to retrieve the incremented entries only and
add the newly appended data to our file. This process has to be automated so
that we need not bother by running the command manually everytime. At a
particular time the job runs and the newly added data is retrieved.
The task is done through Sqoop which acts as a data warehousing tool
between RDBMS and HDFS.
